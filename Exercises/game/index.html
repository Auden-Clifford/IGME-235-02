            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>
                Dig Dug is a <b>1-2 player arcade game</b> in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. <br>
                Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. <br>
                The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. [...] <br>

                This definitely goes under the heading of "Games That Were Made While a Programmer Was on Drugs," or at least had a good imagination. And maybe they were into horror movies too. <br>
