                <h2>Sketch & Planning</h2>

                <p>
                    I started by drawing boxes around each item on the pdf, then I drew grid lines to fit those boxes. The result was a 
                    mostly incomprehensible mess.
                </p>

                </figure>

                <p>
                    I decided to separate this design into two parts: the grids and the content. This created a slightly 
                    less incomprehensible mess.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="src/SpecSketch-split.jpg" alt="My sketch split between the grid and the content it contains.">
                </figure>

                <p>
                    It wasn’t immediately obvious what HTML element would best fit the boxes on the screen, after all, they didn’t 
                    exactly line up semantically with something like a section or a paragraph. Some of them only had images inside 
                    them. I decided on the div-id method. Each of these boxes (in purple) would be a div with a unique ID pertaining 
                    to the information it contains.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The next thing I did was move things around to create a mobile layout. I considered just stacking each item on top 
                    of the next, perhaps in a flexbox rather than a grid. However, I wanted to preserve the criss-cross overlapping 
                    design of the original source, so I decided to make the design fit into a thinner grid. The mobile design would 
                    keep some elements side-by-side, but allow most things to fill in below. I planned for no more than two elements 
                    appearing in the same row, this way the elements would not have to squeeze too much to fit the narrow screen, and 
                    the content would not become unreadable.
