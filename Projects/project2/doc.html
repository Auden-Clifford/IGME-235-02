    <h3>Explanation</h3>

            This web app allows the user to search for Magic: the Gathering cards using the Scryfall API and build decks with them. The user can create multiple decks and edit several properties of them. The decks are then placed in local storage so that they can stay there when the page reloads. I want to specifically bring attention to the building/saving of decks since I believe that this feature is what truly pushes the project above and beyond.
        </p>

        <p>
            Other than that the base requirements have been adequately met. The user’s entire last search query is saved and brought up when the page reloads, the page has 7 search widgets not including the search button as well as 4 buttons for scrolling through the API’s pages. There are also an additional few controls for interacting with cards and decks. I believe that the interface design is easy to understand and aesthetically pleasing and the buttons/widgets are either labeled or are otherwise intuitive to anyone who has at least read a Magic card. The app is not fully responsive, although it should work on most monitor sizes. Despite not being designed for responsiveness it continues to be semi-functional at screen widths as small as 530px, but functions best at screen widths 720px and up. This project makes heavy use of Flexbox and uses a grid to display cards. I considered using a framework for certain things but ultimately didn’t end up doing it.

            I believe that the work I’ve done on this project was above and beyond. The number of extra controls and freedom with which this allows the user to interact with Scryfall alone would constitute college-level work. However, I think it’s the deck building and saving that truly makes this project shine. The process of keeping track of all of the decks’ information and updating the HTML elements that display that information is a complicated process that took a great deal of time and effort to figure out. To judge off of my work alone I would say that I deserve an A. Unfortunately, the project was 1 day late so I’m unlikely to receive full credit.
